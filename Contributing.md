## About the project

The Chef Automate HA equates to reliability, efficiency, and productivity, built on Redundancy and Failover. It aids in addressing significant issues like service failure and zone failure. Please refer to the public  [documentation](https://docs.chef.io/automate/ha/)  of Automate HA for more information.

This project is a documentation-only repository that provides guided steps on how to build and integrate Monitoring, Alerting, and Centralised logging tools with Chef Automate HA. Based on our analysis we have selected a few tools which is our recommendation.



## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation of the repository](https://github.com/chef/monitoring-integration-automate/blob/Adding-Contributing.md/Whitepaper_AutomateHA_Monitoring_and_Alerting.md) and [Automate product] (https://docs.chef.io/automate/ha/).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions, depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Configure AlertManager for Pagerduty

Before performing the following steps, please ensure alertmanager is installed and configured to run as a service. Refer to the [alertmanager installation guide](./Prometheus_Monitor_configuration_and_alerting.md).

The following configuration is designed to receive alerts with severity level `L1`. By default, all alerts will go to Slack. However, the alerts with severity level `L1` will be sent to Padgerduty.

* Perform the following steps to configure alert manager to integration with pagerduty. 

* Update the service key generated by pagerduty in the previous step.

Please note: The keys and webhooks provided in the following configuration are tampered. The keys and webhooks must be updated as per the environment. Add the following configurations to alertmanager.yml file. Refer to the final [alertmanager configuration](.configs/alertmanager.yml) file.

```
vi /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml
```

```
routes:
    - match:
        severity: L1
      receiver: pagerduty
      group_by: ['...']

receivers:
  - name: pagerduty
    pagerduty_configs:
    - service_key: 98c3d3add5de4f0dc0726243ee3fdc62
      send_resolved: true
```

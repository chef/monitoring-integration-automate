## Description

As an Automate HA customer, need to integrate Data Dog with a slack tool to ensure getting notified over the set option in case of any higher severity issue.

Connecting Slack to Datadog to help your team collaborate by:

* Sharing graphs in private or public Slack channels.

* Receiving alerts and notifications from Datadog within Slack.

* Muting triggering monitors and declaring incidents from Slack.

## What youâ€™ll Need

1. In the Slack App select your workspace and chose/create the slack channel for datadog alerts to be triggered in.

1. In Datadog UI:
